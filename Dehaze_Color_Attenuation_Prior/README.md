**Author:** Qingsong Zhu, Jiaming Mai, and Ling Shao

**Conference:** IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2015

This is an implementation of the "A fast Single Image Haze Removal Algorithm Using Color Attenuation Prior" paper. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7128396

## Libraries

opencv-python, numpy, scipy, skimage

## Code

main.py will automatical to read the data from SOTS and HSTS dataset and save the output image

## Output

**Statistic** contain the overall average MSE and SSIM from SOTS and HSTS dataset

**indoor** folder contain SOTS indoor dataset output image and statistic result

**outdoor** folder contain SOTS outdoor dataset output image and statistic result

**synthetic** folder contain HSTS dataset output image and statistic result
